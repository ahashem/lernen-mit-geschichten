## Hikâye


Once upon a time, there was a colorful flamingo named Fritz.
Fritz was cheerful, funny, and always full of ideas.
But… Fritz had a small problem:
He wanted to do everything at the same time!

He wanted to dance, eat, sleep, play, and fly – all in one minute!
In the end, Fritz tripped over his long legs and fell with a big splash into the water.

The fish giggled and said:
“Fritz, you are funny, but this way you’ll never reach your goals!”

Fritz sighed:
“Oh no… how can I get better?”

Suddenly, his friend, the clever spider Susi, appeared.
She said:
“Fritz, you need self-organization!
That means: arranging your time, your behavior, and your feelings.”

Fritz tilted his head:
“Organize? But I’m a flamingo, not a bookshelf!”

Susi laughed and explained:
“Look, I’ll make it simple:

1. Organize your time: Do one thing first, then the next.

2. Organize your behavior: When you dance, then just dance. When you eat, then just eat.

3. Organize your feelings: If you get angry, breathe deeply and count to three.”

Fritz nodded. He wanted to give it a try.

The next day, Fritz made a plan:

In the morning: dancing.

At noon: eating.

In the afternoon: playing with friends.

In the evening: sleeping.

And when he got angry, he said:
“One… two… three… okay, everything is fine again!”

The animals were amazed and said:
“Wow, Fritz! You are really organized now!”

Fritz smiled proudly and said:
“Yes! Now I have order in my head, my heart, and my legs!”

From that day on, Fritz wasn’t just a funny, colorful flamingo.
He became a flamingo with self-control –
and that made him a true role model.

🐭 "Lina and the Big Cookie"

Once upon a time, there was a little mouse named Lina.

Lina loved cookies more than anything!

One day, she found a huge cookie right in the middle of the kitchen table.

“Hooray! It’s my lucky day!” she squeaked happily.

But there was a problem: the cookie was far too big, and the table was far too high.

Lina tried to jump up. Plop! She fell down again.

She pushed a spoon under the table and tried to climb up. Wobble… crash! The spoon slipped away.

“Hmmm… how can I get up there?” Lina murmured.

Then she remembered:

“If one plan doesn’t work, I have to try another!”

First, she called her friend, the sparrow Pico.

Pico fluttered and tried to peck at the cookie – but it was much too heavy for him.

Then came the turtle Tilda. She said slowly:

“We could… build something together.”

So they started to collect things:

Pico brought little twigs.

Tilda pushed an old toy car.

Lina gathered buttons and strings.

Together they built a wobbly but funny little ladder.

Step by step, Lina climbed up.

And finally – munch, munch – she reached the big cookie!

Instead of eating it all alone, Lina shouted:

“Come, let’s share it! Without you, I wouldn’t have made it.”

So the mouse, the sparrow, and the turtle sat in a circle, eating the cookie and laughing about their crazy ideas.

And Lina thought happily:

“Problems aren’t scary… when we try new ways!”

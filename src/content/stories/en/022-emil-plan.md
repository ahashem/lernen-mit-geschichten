## The Story


In a small village lived a boy named Emil.
Emil was curious, but sometimes he was also a little stubborn.
He often thought: “This is how I always do it, so I’ll do it the same way again!”

One day, Emil wanted to bake a giant apple pie.
He took flour, eggs, sugar – and of course, lots of apples.
But suddenly – oh no! – the oven was broken.

“What? Without an oven? Then there will be no pie!” cried Emil sadly.

His friend Leni giggled and said:
“Maybe we can make the pie in a different way. Think, Emil!”

Emil frowned and stomped his foot:
“No! Pie without an oven is impossible!”

But then he saw his cat Minka playing happily in a bowl of apples.
“Wait a minute… maybe we just have to think differently!” Emil shouted.

So they tried new ideas:

They made apple skewers over the campfire.

Then they cooked little apple pockets in the pan.

And finally, they prepared a magic apple drink in the blender.

All the children in the village came, laughed, and enjoyed the treats.
“Emil, your plan was crazy, but delicious!” they said.

Emil grinned and said:
“I have learned something: If something doesn’t work, you just need to change direction – like an apple rolling in the field!”

And from that day on, Emil was known as:
“The boy with a thousand ideas.”

✨ Message of the story:

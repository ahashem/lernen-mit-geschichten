## The Story


Once upon a time, there was a small grey mouse named Moritz.
Moritz was very curious – and sometimes a little impatient.

One sunny morning, Moritz ran through the forest. Suddenly, he heard a loud: “Ouch!”
Under a bush sat the hedgehog Fritz, who had pricked his foot on a thorn.

Moritz laughed and said:
“Haha! You look like a cactus!”

Fritz looked sad and said:
“But it really hurts…”

Then Moritz realized: His laughter didn’t make his friend feel better – it made him feel worse.
He stopped, took a deep breath, and said:
“Oh, I’m sorry, Fritz. I didn’t want to hurt you. Do you want me to help you?”

Fritz nodded. Carefully, Moritz pulled out the thorn.
“Thank you, Moritz,” said Fritz with a smile.

Moritz felt a warm and happy feeling inside his heart.
He understood: When we notice other people’s feelings and take them seriously, we also feel happy ourselves.

From that day on, Moritz listened not only with his ears, but also with his heart.
And whenever he saw someone sad, he asked: “How can I help you?”

All the animals in the forest liked him for that – and they even gave him a sweet nickname:
“The little mouse with the big heart.” 💖

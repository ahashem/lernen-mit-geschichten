## The Story


Once upon a time there was a little dinosaur called Dino Dino.
Dino Dino was green, round-bellied, and always hungry.
His favorite food was – of course – giant cookies. 🍪

One day his Grandma baked a mountain of fresh cookies.
The whole cave smelled like chocolate.
Grandma said firmly:
“But you must wait until the cookies are cool!
If you eat too soon, you’ll burn your tongue!”

Dino Dino sniffed.
He drooled.
He walked in circles and shouted:
“I want a cookie NOW!”

But Grandma shook her head:
“Patience, my little Dino.”

The Funny Waiting

Dino Dino tried not to think about cookies.
So he played with his tail – plop! – he fell down.
He counted stones in the cave – one, two, three… until he forgot the numbers.
Then he made silly faces in the mirror:
“Grrr!”, “Heee!”, “Blubb!” 🤪
He laughed so much that he almost forgot the cookies.

The Reward

Finally Grandma called:
“Now the cookies are cool!”

Dino Dino jumped high, almost touching the ceiling.
He took a big bite.
“Mmmmh!” he shouted with full cheeks.
“It was really worth waiting!”

Grandma smiled:
“You see, whoever waits gets the best taste in the end.”

Dino Dino nodded and said:
“I am Dino Dino, the great Patience Dino!” 🦖✨

And from that day on he could wait much better –
well… almost always. 😉

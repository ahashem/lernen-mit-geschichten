# 🐻 Bruno's Colorful Feelings

Once upon a time, there was a little bear named Bruno.

Bruno loved honey, playing in the forest, and – especially – climbing trees.

One day, Bruno wanted to show his friend, the owl Mila, how high he could climb.

He climbed… higher… and higher… but suddenly he slipped!

"Oh no!" cried Bruno. His heart was beating like a drum.

He sat down on the ground and said:

"My tummy feels strange. I think I am scared."

Mila flew to him and said:

"Good that you noticed, Bruno! When you know what you feel, it's easier to handle it."

Bruno thought for a moment, then smiled:

"When I'm scared, I need a break. I take a deep breath… in… and out."

Later, while playing, Bruno stumbled over a stone.

He growled: "Grrr, now I am angry!"

Mila nodded: "You noticed it! And what do you do when you are angry?"

Bruno thought for a moment and said:

"I stomp my feet once, and then I feel better!" – stomp, stomp!

They both laughed.

In the evening, when the sun went down, Bruno said softly:

"Now I feel happy. I learned:

When I know my feelings, I can better decide what to do."

Mila winked and said:

"Exactly, Bruno. That is the superpower of self-awareness!"

And Bruno fell asleep happily, with a big honey-sweet smile on his face.

## 🌟 Message for Children

When I pay attention to my body (my heart beats fast, my tummy feels strange …), I notice: I feel something.

When I name the feeling (scared, angry, happy …), I can choose a better way to react.

This is the superpower of self-awareness!

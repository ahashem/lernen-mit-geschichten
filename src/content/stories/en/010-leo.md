## The Story


Once upon a time, there was a little lion named Leo.
Leo was strong and brave – but also a little clumsy.

One day, his mother said:
“Leo, today we will practice being kind and doing our tasks well.”

Leo nodded. But it wasn’t easy at all!

---

🍎 The First Task

Leo had to bring apples to his friends.
Usually, he would eat all the apples by himself – yum, yum, yum!
But this time he shared them kindly.

His friend, the monkey, shouted:
“Thank you, Leo! That was great!”

Leo smiled and thought:
“Wow! I was kind! I’ll reward myself with a little dance!”
And he danced like a funny lion. Everyone laughed!

---

🧹 The Second Task

In the afternoon, Leo had to clean up his nest.
“Oh nooo… boring!” he grumbled.

But he did it anyway.

When he finished, he said proudly:
“Well done, Leo! My reward will be an extra portion of honey!”
He licked the honey happily and purred with joy.

🐠 The Third Task

At the river, Leo saw a little fish stuck.
He carefully helped it back into the water.

The fish cried:
“Splash, splash, thank you, Leo!”

Leo giggled and said to himself:
“I was brave and helpful. My reward will be to tell a funny joke!”
So he said: “What does a lion do when he wants pizza? – He roars: Pizzzaaa!”
All the animals laughed, even the fish.

🌟 The Lesson

In the evening, Leo thought:
“When I do something good and reward myself, it’s double the fun!
That way, I will always get better.”

And so Leo learned:
Good behavior grows stronger when we reward ourselves kindly.

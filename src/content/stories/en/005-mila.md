## The Story


Once upon a time, there was a cheerful girl named Mila, who was always full of ideas.
One day, Mila was playing with her best friend, the little rabbit Hoppel, in the garden.

Mila shouted excitedly:
“Hoppel, let’s play tag!”

But Hoppel looked at the balloon he was holding in his paws.
“I’d rather hop with the balloon today,” he said quietly.

Mila frowned a little. She really wanted to run and laugh loudly.
“Ah, Hoppel, why didn’t you tell me that more clearly?” she asked.

Then Hoppel jumped up and said:
“Okay, Mila. I feel a little tired today. I would like to play with the balloon quietly. But I still want to spend time with you.”

Mila smiled and said:
“Thank you for explaining your feelings to me! You know what? We can first play with the balloon, and then play tag afterwards. That way, we’ll both be happy!”

Hoppel clapped his paws.
“Yes! That’s a good idea. I like it when we honestly say what we want.”

So they played together: first with the balloon, and then tag. They both laughed and felt understood.

At the end Mila said:
“You know, Hoppel? When we express our wishes and feelings clearly and kindly, the other person understands us better. That makes friendship even stronger!”

And the little rabbit nodded.
“Exactly, Mila. Honest words are like a colorful balloon – they bring joy and fly high!” 🎈

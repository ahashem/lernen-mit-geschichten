🐿️ The Story of Fritzchen and the Angry Squirrel

Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Fritzchen.

Fritzchen loved playing in the playground, running, laughing, and climbing.

One day, he was sitting under a tree, eating a delicious apple.

Suddenly, a squirrel jumped down from a branch and snatched a piece of the apple!

Fritzchen shouted:

"Hey! That’s MY apple!"

His face turned red with anger.

He was about to scream and stomp his feet – but then he remembered his grandmother’s advice:

👉 “When you are angry, count slowly to five and take a deep breath.”

So Fritzchen took a deep breath and said: “Puuuh…”

Then he counted: “One… two… three… four… five…”

And suddenly:

His heart beat calmly, his face brightened, and he started to laugh.

The squirrel was nibbling the apple with its tiny mouth and looked so funny

that Fritzchen couldn’t stay angry anymore.

He giggled and said:

“Alright, little squirrel, we’ll share the apple.”

From that day on, Fritzchen knew:

Whoever stays calm will have more fun in the end –

and maybe even a new friend. 🐿️🍎

## The Story


It was a sunny morning in the forest. The little raccoon Finn was happily hopping through the leaves. Suddenly, he saw something shiny between the trees.

He shouted: “Oh! A giant nut!” It was almost as big as a football.

Finn tried to roll the nut by himself. He pushed, he pressed, he puffed – but the nut barely moved.

The lively squirrel Mila passed by and said:
“Hello, Finn! Do you need help?”
Finn nodded and said: “Yes, but it’s sooo heavy!”

Mila laughed and said: “Together we can do it!” So they started to roll the nut a little.

But the nut got stuck in a small hole.
Finn sighed sadly: “Oh no!”

At that moment, the colorful bird Kiko landed and asked:
“What’s going on here?”
Mila answered: “We want to take the nut to the big tree, but it’s stuck!”

Kiko thought for a moment and then said: “I have an idea! I’ll bring my friends, the ants. They’re small, but very strong when they work together.”

Soon, a whole army of ants came marching, calling: “We will help!”

Finn pushed, Mila pulled, Kiko flapped his wings, and the ants lifted from below. Slowly, the giant nut began to move.

“One, two, three – push!” shouted Finn. Everyone laughed and joined in.

At last, they rolled the nut all the way to the big tree. There they cracked it open together and shared the tasty kernels.

Finn smiled and said: “Alone I could never have done it. But together we were strong!”

Mila nodded: “Teamwork is fun!”
And Kiko flapped happily: “Together, no one can beat us!”

From that day on, all the forest animals knew:
Whoever works together can finish even the hardest tasks – and have lots of fun, too.

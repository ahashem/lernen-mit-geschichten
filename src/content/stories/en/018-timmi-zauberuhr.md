## The Story


Once upon a time, there was a cheerful boy named Timmy who only wanted to play all day long.
His toys were scattered everywhere: the building blocks on the bed, the cars under the table, and even the coloring pencils inside his shoes!

One morning, his mother said:
“Timmy, today you have three important things to do: learning 📚, playing 🎲, and resting 😴. But how will you manage all of them?”

Timmy shrugged his shoulders:
“Hmm… maybe I’ll just play all day?”

Suddenly, his talking stuffed cat Minka giggled and said:
“Meow! I have an idea! Here is a magic clock. It will help you organize your time.”

The magic clock went tick-tock, tick-tock and showed bright colors:

Blue for learning 📚

Yellow for playing 🎲

Green for resting 😴

Timmy tried it out:

When the clock turned blue, he sat down and practiced the alphabet. Minka sang a funny song: “A, B, C, I dance like a kangaroo!” Timmy laughed, but he still learned.

Then the clock turned yellow. Timmy jumped up, built a giant road for his cars, and Minka slid along laughing.

Later, the clock turned green. Timmy lay down on the sofa, closed his eyes, and Minka purred like a little motorboat.

In the evening, Timmy was very happy.
“Wow! I learned, I played, and I rested – I did everything!” he said proudly.

Minka smiled:
“Meow! Whoever shares their time wisely will always have enough for learning, playing, and dreaming!”

And so Timmy fell asleep peacefully, with the magic clock beside his bed.

✨ Lesson for Children:
When you organize your time, you always have space for everything: learning, playing, and resting.

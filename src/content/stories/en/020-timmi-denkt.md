## The Story


Once upon a time, there was a little raccoon named Timmi.
Timmi was curious, playful, and always full of ideas. But sometimes, he did things without thinking first.

One day, Timmi saw a big apple tree. The red apples were hanging high up in the branches.
“Oh, I’ll get those apples!” he shouted and started to climb.

But suddenly, he heard a loud Crack! – the branch shook dangerously.
His friend, the clever squirrel Lilli, called out:
“Timmi! Think first! What will happen if the branch breaks?”

Timmi stopped for a moment and imagined:
If the branch breaks, I will fall down. That will hurt. And I still won’t get the apples.

So Timmi carefully climbed back down and thought:
“Hmm… maybe I can use a stick to knock the apples down.”

Lilli laughed: “See? When you think first, you find a better solution!”

Timmi found a long stick. He poked the apples gently – Plop! – and one apple fell to the ground.
They both laughed and ate happily.

At the end, Timmi said proudly:
“Today I learned: First think, then act!”

✨ Moral of the story: Children learn playfully that thinking about the consequences before acting leads to smarter and safer decisions.

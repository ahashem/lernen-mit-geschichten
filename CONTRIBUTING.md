- **No machine translation** - all translations must be human-reviewed

**Translation Process:**
1. Check existing stories in `src/content/stories/de/` for stories needing translation
2. Translate the full story content (narrative, key messages, quiz questions)
3. Add translated frontmatter fields (titleAr, titleEn, titleTr, titleUr)
4. Test RTL layout if translating to Arabic or Urdu
5. Submit a Pull Request with your translation

### Adding New Stories

**Story Requirements:**
- Target age: 3-7 years

  - Fill-in-the-blank questions (2-3)

**Story Submission Process:**
1. Review existing stories for format and structure
2. Create your story in Markdown format
3. Add appropriate frontmatter metadata
4. Include an emoji character icon
5. Write engaging activities that reinforce the story's message
